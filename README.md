# Challenging Alarm Clock App

This repo is about creating an alarm clock app that is challenging the user by making him/her to solve a problem before the alarm sound stops.

## Getting Started


To run and debug the app, 
run ```main.dart``` on a device like on a physically available smartphone, 
on a virtually created smartphone
or on the Chrome browser for example.
To refresh the project, it's possible to use the hot reload function. 

To see the wireframe of the app, click on "Open Flutter DevTools" in the debug window below 
while running the debug mode.
