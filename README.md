# Challenging Alarm Clock App

Alarm clock app

## Getting Started


To run and debug the app, 
run ```main.dart``` on a device like on a physically available smartphone, 
on a virtually created smartphone
or on the Chrome browser for example.
To refresh the project, it's possible to use the hot reload function. 

To see the wireframe of the app, click on "Open Flutter DevTools" in the debug window below 
while running the debug mode.
